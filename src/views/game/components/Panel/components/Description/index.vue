</div><p><br><span style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Introduction To Sweet Bonanza (Pragmatic Play) At BC.GAME</strong></span><br></p><p><br>Sweet Bonanza at BC.GAME is a slot machine that utilizes cluster payouts rather than paylines. The dimension of the grid is 6 by 5, which indicates that there may be no more than 30 instances of the very same symbol in a cluster. Symbols that are part of winning combos vanish to make place for new symbols, giving the opportunity to string together consecutive sugary wins. <br><br><strong>Delectable symbols</strong> are everywhere in Sweet Bonanza. There are both fruits and candies scattered along the reels. The fruits ironically make up the lower pay symbols with multipliers of 0,25x to 10x your bet. The candies bring much sweeter wins between 1.5x to 50x your bet for 8 or more symbols of a kind. The scatter symbol is styled as a lollipop, and the features it brings make it even more appetizing; landing 4 will activate 10 free spins with a 3x multiplier, while 6 will bring both the bonus feature and a 100x multiplier on your initial bet! <br><br><strong>Tumble wins</strong> the main attraction to Sweet Bonanza at BC.GAME, symbols that have triggered a winning combo will fall away and make place for new symbols. There's also a win-all-ways feature, meaning if 8 symbols of a kind land anywhere on the reels, you win. The sequence of cascading wins continues until no more winning combos land. It's not the first time we've seen this feature, but it's certainly a welcomed treat nonetheless. <br><br><strong>Mystery multipliers </strong>add explosive gameplay to Sweet Bonanza. These symbols are aptly designed as colorful sugar bombs. Each sugar bomb has the potential to award a random multiplier between 2x and 100x your bet. If more than one multiplier lands across the reels, the values will be added to a universal multiplier, and the initial winning combo will then be multiplied. This is where the tumble feature can bring extremely lucrative gameplay and consecutive wins with multipliers. It sounds bananas! <br><br><strong>Bonus Buy </strong>for all the eager players out there. The most alluring features of Sweet Bonanza lie within the bonus rounds, where an opportunity of 21,175x your base bet awaits you. Of course, the feature only comes so often, and the cravings can become overwhelming. Players will be able to buy into the free spins feature for 100x the base bet. Other times, you can pay to double your chances of landing 4 lollipop scatters for 25x of your initial bet. <br><img src="https://bc.imgix.net/gameinfo/image/81/64/eb/166313906178098.jpeg" alt="" data-="" style=""><br><span style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Strategy for Sweet Bonanza (Pragmatic Play)</strong></span><br></p><p><br>While Sweet Bonanza at BC.GAME may not actually cause high blood sugar, but chasing the maximum win potential of 21,175x might provide a few spikes in your blood pressure. The free spins round of Sweet Bonanza certainly offers better chances of winning big. However, the volatility here is above average, so we advise you to keep your bet range on the lower side. While you may not see big wins in the base game due to smaller bets, once the bonus feature begins, you can string enormous multipliers together for flavourful wins. Therefore it's crucial you hold back your childlike urges and not buy into the sweetened bonus rounds. Here, stay patient with smaller bets and wait till 4 of those lollipop scatters land; by then, you'll feel like a kid in a candy store! <br><br><span style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Sweet Bonanza (Pragmatic Play): Summary </strong></span><br></p><p><br>Each free spin is sweet like candy, and "You never know what you're going to get" because of the random multipliers that might appear throughout those spins. We had a great time playing Sweet Bonanza; we have to admit that it does help once you can reach the bonus round, where the win-all-ways, tumble feature, and multipliers really come into play. While the theme isn't unexplored, Pragmatic Play has added just enough features to create a craving. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p></div></div>`
